                However, as the space keeps expanding and people proceed to mint
                thousands of NFTs every day, an important question arises - how
                do we make sure that all that creative work remains accessible
                over time?
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-400 mt-4">
                Earlier this year, as NFTs began hitting the mainstream, the
                industry faced a major technical problem. As highlighted by some
                analysts, most of the JPEGs (or other file formats) that serve
                as the media basis for their respective NFTs weren t stored on
                the chain itself. Instead, NFTs often simply redirected to a URL
                where the corresponding media was hosted - in most cases, that
                was a separate domain that belonged to either the creator or the
                platform where that NFT was minted.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-400 mt-4">
                But what happens when those domains go down? With that
                discovery, it became apparent that some NFTs have a single point
                of failure, which, in turn, could significantly impact their
                longevity and value.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-400 mt-4">
                In light of that, numerous projects and organisations have begun
                working on a potential fix. In a recent Clubhouse session, we
                brought those pioneering protocols and projects - Protocol Labs
                (an open-source lab that is working on Filecoin, IPFS and
                libp2p), Async.art, Fleek and Arweave - together to have a
                constructive discussion about the future of NFT metadata. Here s
                a concise recap of the main ideas that were discussed there.

              <p className="text-slate-400 mt-4">
                This is the part that takes a bit of open-mindedness. An NFT is
                a unique digital token, with most using the ethereum blockchain
                to digitally record transactions. It s not a cryptocurrency like
                bitcoin or ether, because those are fungible -- exchangeable for
                another bitcoin or cash. NFTs are recorded in a digital ledger
                in the same way as cryptocurrency, so there s a listing of who
                owns each one.
              </p>
              <p className="text-slate-400 mt-4">
                What makes an NFT unique is the digital asset tied to the token.
                This can be an image, video, tweet or piece of music that s
                uploaded to a marketplace, which creates the NFT to be sold.
